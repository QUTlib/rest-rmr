// ----- IMPORTANT ------------------------------------------------------
// Note: the order is HTML > XHTML > XML > JSON > YAML.
//
//       HTML first because that's the defacto standard content-type for
//       resource delivery on the web.
//        * Note that the HTMLRepresenter only represents HTMLDocument
//          objects.
//
//       XHTML and XML second and third because most web browsers accept
//       application/xhtml+xml and application/xml with similar preference,
//       and XHTML is more "web friendly" than XML.
//        * Note that the XHTMLRepresenter only represents HTMLDocument
//          objects, or XML DOM-type objects with a <html> root element.
//
//       JSON fourth because he delivers data in a 'text/*' format, so
//       browsers are less likely to barf at it (some browsers are happy
//       to render any text/*, while they all force the user to download
//       application/* -- and I hate that.)
//
//       Finally YAML because it's an awesome format and everyone should
//       support it.
